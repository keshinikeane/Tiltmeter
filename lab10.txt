TiltDemo.java
  
Complete all methods as specified. You will need to read 
documentation for the class edu.mines.jtk.dsp.Sampling 
in the Mines Java Toolkit.
  
I recommend that you complete the methods in the order in 
which they appear in the class TiltDemo. Initially, 
comment out any calls to methods not yet completed.
  
In your program, you must close any file that you open.
  
Check your method despike by zooming in the plot of input 
and output sequences. You zoom by clicking and dragging in 
the plot or its axes.
  
Note how the plots of tiltmeter data are constructed. 
You may want to use classes such as SimplePlot again.
